Speaker design notes
--------------------

I used two tools to help design the speaker enclosures: the Vented Box Calculator at mh-audio.nl, and the WinISD tool. Results from both tools are included here. They are quite similar, but I ended up using the results from WinISD with an arbitrary shape for the rectangular port. The overall design was a compromise between acoustics, aesthetics, available space, the required tesselation, and printability.
